# IotT-Based-Weather-Monitoring-System
This project introduces an advanced IoT-based weather monitoring system powered by the ESP8266 microcontroller. The system integrates temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure sensors, enabling real-time data collection. Utilizing the ESP8266's low power consumption and seamless connectivity, the collected data is processed and transmitted wirelessly to a secure cloud server. Users can access this information remotely through web and mobile applications, fostering data-driven decision-making in sectors such as agriculture and disaster management.
